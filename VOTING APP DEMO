My observations:
Observations after deleting the pods :

What happened after deleting voting pod?
  Command used : kubectl delete po vote-76349dc97-9w5sp
  Stopped the voting application.
  A new pod gets created with a new pod name.
  
What happened after deleting worker pod?
  Command used : kubectl delete po worker-ddasf3484-8dk8t
                 kubectl logs pod_name
  Pod terminated and new pod created.
  No major issues.
  
What happened after deleting worker pod?
  Command used : kubectl delete po result-sahaf9584-1vk8m
  Application was running but functionality was missing.

What happened after db pod deletion?
  Command used : kubectl delete po db-h74cd94f4-mclmv
  Votes are captured.
  Results page doesn't work. Doesn't show no.of pods. The connection between the result pod and the db pod was stopped.(Why result app STOPPED working after deleting the db pod?)
  Container within Worker pod got restarted. DB couldn't connect to worker so it restarted worker.


How to make the RESULT POD work again?
  The connection got established back, after deleting the results pod.
